# Python AI Stuff
This contains a maze solver and a (comparatively smaller) constraint satisfaction project, which involves allocating classes to classrooms based on class times and seats available.

## A* Maze Solver
Using Pygame for visuals, this is a maze solver which always returns the optimal solution (if one is available), using the reliable A* search algorithm. 

You can supply these as parameters to the program, or go with the defaults:
- **Density**: recommended 15 to 50, but not below 0 or 100. A higher number means there will be more obstacles, and consequently a higher chance that the maze won't be solvable. *Defaults to 25*
- **Board Size**: should be at least 10, but never below 0. The board generated by this program will be `n` by `n` tiles. *Defaults to 50*
- **Diagonal movement allowed**: If 'y' is inputted, then diagonal movements will be permitted with a cost of 1 (like horizontal/vertical movements). Any other input will ban diagonal movement, leaving only horizontal/vertical movements available. *Defaults to NO*

### Technical Stuff
**Chebyshev Distance Heuristic** if diagonal movement is allowed.
$$h = \max\left(|x_2 - x_1|, |y_2 - y_1|\right)$$

**Manhattan Distance Heuristic** if diagonal movement is not allowed.
$$h = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|$$

## Constraint Satisfaction Classroom Allocator
This is a demonstration of the AC-3 algorithm, which is used for constraint satisfaction, a process in artificial intelligence. Given random courses and rooms available, **the aim is to allocate every course section to a room, with no two classes using the same room at the same time.**.

*See output.txt for a sample output file. This was not run with the course restriction, and took a few tries to get!*

Here, we use it to allocate sections of courses to rooms based on numerous factors:
- Class size (random, but higher codes generally mean less seats)
- Timeslots
- Rooms available

Course sections are randomly generated with random times and sizes. Rooms are also randomly generated with random capacities.

If the algorithm completes:
- Each course's domain (which has all possible rooms) is reduced to just one room which holds as little seats as possible while fitting the course
    (i.e. for a course with 40 seats, we want a room with 40 seats over a room with 70)
- A file 'output.txt' is written to which lists what room each course is allocated to.

### Technical Stuff
Out of the pool of courses available, only about half of these will generally be used in a run to avoid frequent runs that result in empty domains. You *can* remove this limit, but unsolvable world states may happen more often as a result.
